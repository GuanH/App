# App
Until then I didn't find any suitable program for me,\
So I made this for myself to learn English in my preferred way when I was 18. (I found a better program later tho)
# Function:
  1.Simple dictionary with chinese translation and example sentences\
  2.Pretest to collect the unfamiliar vocabularies\
  3.Randomly select a word in the collection and you need to choose the corresponding chinese translation
# Existing problems:
  1.Crash due to unknown reasons\
  2.Typos, many typos
